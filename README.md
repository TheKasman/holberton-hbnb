HBnB

This repository contains the deliverables for Part 1 of the HBnB project.
The focus of this stage is on system design, including architecture planning, class modelling, and behavioural analysis through sequence diagrams.

Technical_Document.pdf
    A compiled technical document containing:
      - High‑level architecture overview
      - Package diagram
      - Business Logic class diagram
      - Sequence diagrams for key interactions
      - Explanations of design decisions and system behaviour
    This document acts as the blueprint for the HBnB system and demonstrates our understanding of the architecture before implementation.

🎯 Purpose of Part 1
Part 1 focuses on planning the system before writing code.
The goal is to:
- Define the structure of the system
- Model the core entities and their relationships
- Understand how the system behaves through sequence diagrams
- Establish a clear architectural foundation for later development
